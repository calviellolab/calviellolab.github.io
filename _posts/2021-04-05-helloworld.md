The lab website is born! Goal: populating the internet with unbiased investigations into post-transcriptional gene regulation.
The Calviello lab will start in September 2021 at the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/" target="_blank">Human Technopole</a>, in the Genomics - Functional Genomics department, in association with the Computational Biology Centre.
Looking forward to this great opportunity, and a special thanks to my mentors, Stephen Floor (UCSF), Uwe Ohler (BIMSB) and Roberto Marangoni (UniPi), and many other colleagues, who have guided me so far with their great supervision. Forever grateful!
