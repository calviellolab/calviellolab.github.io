The lab website is born! Goal: populating the internet with unbiased investigations into post-transcriptional gene regulation.
The Calviello lab will start in September 2021 at the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/" target="_blank">Human Technopole</a>, in the Genomics - Functional Genomics department, in association with the Computational Biology Centre.
Looking forward to this great opportunity!
