The lab is currently looking for a lab technician, PhD students (through the <a href="https://www.semm.it/education/phd-program-systems-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEMM PhD program</a>) and postdocs, both in computational and experimental space.
As an overview, members of the lab (especially the PI!) are expected to:

- Be honest, with yourself and your peers.
- Have genuine interest and curiosity towards both experimental and analytical aspects of projects. An elegantly designed experiment is as illuminating as an innovative computational method.	
- Show independence towards learning in a multidisciplinary group focused on understanding mRNA translation, where biochemistry meets cell biology, gene regulation, signal processing and machine learning.
- Not be afraid of handling coverage tracks, statistical tests, or classifier performance metrics. They’re just numbers!
- Keep organized protocols and write reproducible code.
- Frequently discuss results and ideas highlighting controls and potential pitfalls, using concise and clear presentations.
- Interact lively with colleagues in the lab, other departments, and the larger scientific community in various events (journal clubs, lab meetings, seminars, hackathons, international conferences).
- Communicate clearly when problems arise and propose possible solutions.
- Respect their own and other colleagues’ work towards fostering a transparent, collaborative, stimulating, and welcoming scientific environment.
