title: Integrative -omics in mRNA biology
subtitle: Calviello lab at the Human Technopole
---

# Welcome to the Calviello lab!
<br>
We are a new multidisciplinary research group in the Functional Genomics center (associated with the Computational Biology center) at the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/" target="_blank">Human Technopole</a> in Milan, Italy, starting from fall 2021.
<br>
We are interested in post-transcriptional gene regulation in humans, employing computational (genomic data analysis, machine learning, signal processing) and experimental methods (protein and RNA biochemistry, transcriptomics and proteomics techniques, cell biology, genome and transcriptome engineering) revolving around the -omics of translation,
a fundamental process which dictates the functions of the transcribed genome, and impacts the cytoplasmic fate of mRNAs and proteins.
